## What is this repo about?

I made this repo so i can show my progress all in one file as i keep on learning to code.

this repo is mainly for my time in devslops as i finish challenges and homeworks.

## First Push

The first push was an exercise about favorites and none favorites from devslops. It a list that uses the table elements to construct and is only a shell for what we will do to it in the css portion/section.
